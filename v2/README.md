# Astrologico API v2 (Alpha)

This is the official documentation for the version 2 of the API. Version 2 is a complete redesign and rewrite of version 1 and offers better scalability which enables more complex features. This version is being actively developed and updates will be posted here regularly.

[Feb 2021 Update] - v2 is still a work in progress despite delays due to the pandemic and other open source projects. All the base dependencies are being built from ground up as much as possible to reduce reliance on third party software. Astrologico API will also soon be rebranded and moved to a dedicated website.
